      answer:
        "An auto DM tool (also called auto DM software or DM automation tool) sends Instagram direct messages automatically when a trigger fires — for example a keyword in a comment, a story reply, or an inbound DM. Liffio is an auto DM tool that lets you set delays (10–60 seconds), personalize messages, and run comment-to-DM flows without manual inbox work.",

      answer:
        "Auto DMs are automated direct messages sent by an auto DM tool when someone triggers a specific action — like commenting a keyword on your post, replying to your story, or sending you a DM. With Liffio's auto DMs, you set up the trigger once, and the tool sends your pre-written message automatically 24/7.",

      answer:
        "An auto comment tool (or auto comment reply tool) replies publicly under your Instagram post and can send a matching private DM. Liffio combines auto comment reply with comment-to-DM automation so one keyword trigger handles both the public reply and the automated DM — the signature workflow of tools like ManyChat.",

We offer the same comment-to-DM, auto comment reply, and story automation features as ManyChat, SendDM, and SuperProfile — without per-message limits.",

      id: "comment-to-dm",
      question: "How does comment-to-DM automation work?",
      answer:
        'Comment-to-DM is the core feature of any auto DM tool. You choose keywords (for example "LINK" or "GUIDE"). When someone comments that word on a post or Reel, Liffio sends your auto DM after your chosen delay and can post a public auto comment reply under their comment — the same pattern used by ManyChat, SendDM, and other Instagram auto DM tools.',

      question: "What is Instagram auto reply?",
      answer:
        "Instagram auto reply refers to any automated response sent when someone interacts with your account — via comments, stories, DMs, or live streams. Liffio's auto reply features include auto DMs from comments, story reply automation, DM auto responders, and live comment triggers. All powered by the same auto DM tool technology.",

      question: "Are auto DM tools safe for my Instagram account?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when you use a compliant auto DM tool like Liffio. We use official Instagram APIs, human-like delays (10-60 seconds), and rate limiting to keep your account safe. Unlike unofficial bots, Liffio's auto DMs don't risk account suspension.",
